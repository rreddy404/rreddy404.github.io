# Testing is Critical

It’s a controlled gamble — a responsible way to explore the unknown.  
The goal of a test is to evaluate a hypothesis. It can be based on extensive technical analysis like MMMs, in‑platform tests, or simply the intuition of stakeholders.  

Whether the basis of the test is diligent analysis or just gun‑slinging, the principles of measurement hold.

## 1) Keep it simple, sailor
Tests are best when they’re explainable and easy to understand. Many teams try to test every aspect of their business at once. In my experience, a **three‑cell design** should be the upper bound for a single test.

This limit reflects reality: businesses have millions of moving parts—each channel, business arm, and team lead has its own priorities and makes adjustments. It’s nearly impossible to account for all of them. Keeping the setup simple and broad helps reduce confusion and avoid getting mired in minutiae.

## 2) Test quickly and test often
Teams often feel pressured to test everything at once, treating each experiment as their one shot. This can lead to convoluted designs where both analytics and business leads lose sight of the objective.

Break this habit by making testing a **regular part of operations**. Frequent experiments let you know—definitively—whether an approach works. They also encourage creativity, calculated risk‑taking, and higher engagement from your team.

## 3) Give yourself runway
There are competing drivers in experimentation:

- **Larger tests**  
  Offer bigger sample sizes, reduced margins of error, and greater data reliability — but come with higher capital risk, more implementation effort, and a reduced pool for future immediate testing.

- **Smaller tests**  
  May require more care in selecting markets or populations and may be more prone to anomalies or higher error margins. However, they can be implemented quickly, with minimal capital, and allow continuous testing without reusing the same sample.

**Tip:** Reserve large tests for replicating a treatment effect from a previously successful small test on a broader population.

## 4) Make it scalable
Design every test with scalability in mind. The treatment should be reliably reproducible for a large portion of your target population. From media buying to creative execution, your setup should be easy to implement across the full consideration set.

## 5) Not all tests work — but all tests teach
Every test provides learnings — **especially failures**. Post‑mortems can be the most valuable part of the process, revealing what went wrong and where. Fold these lessons into your next experiment.
