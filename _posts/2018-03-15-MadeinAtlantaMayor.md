In the past, I have attended the Consumer Show, which showcases local start-ups and local accomplishments. These events have always been very informative and really showcased the kinds of markets people do not normally consider. 

**However!** I jumped when I saw Thursday's Made in Atlanta event because it featured former Atlanta Mayor, Kasim Reed.

It was the first time I've seen the former mayor speak in person and I immediately understood how he won office.
Mr.Reed is an extremely gifted speaker who can jump between talking points and personal quips.

He never shied away from being himself, and was always personable.

The brunt of his talk focused on the importance of the technology industry in Atlanta and how we have positioned ourself for growth in the sector. He spoke on the benefits of being entrepreneurship and risk taking. 
His goal as mayor was focused on making the city of Atlanta an incubator of growth and highlighted the need for inclusion.

One of the topics that he always circled back to was gentrification.
He noted that all of the benefits of making the city better were, by nature, making it harder for people of lower income to stay.
The benefits of growth should not just impact those positioned for success.
People who want to live in the city and have lived in the city cannot be pushed to the margins of society because they've been outgrown.

I personally appreciated that in a room full of people praising the growth of the tech industry, he always brought up the unintended consequences of that growth.
He kept people in mind when speaking of the future.

Positive things can impact some in negative ways.
We need to temper the benefits of growth with the reality of its effect on those not in its path.
